Free Cell

Move all cards onto the foundation cells (the four cells at the top right of the display). Buildup in suit from Ace to King. The four cells at the top left are known as the open cells. You can only place one card in each open cell. The 8 tableau piles can be built downwards in cascades alternating by colour. Any open cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty open cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.
